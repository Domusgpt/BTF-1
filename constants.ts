    fullContent: 'The ocean is entropy—a vast, chaotic system. Yet, schools of tuna move with telepathic synchronization. We mimic this biological order. Our processing facility transforms the chaotic nature of a catch into precise, graded, and structured inventory. We don\'t just process fish; we impose a beautiful, scientific order upon nature\'s bounty.',

    fullContent: 'Our Yellowfin Tuna is the diamond of the deep. Caught in the pristine waters off Panama, each fish is immediately bled and cooled. The CO-treatment process is an art form—locking in the ruby-red vibrancy that signifies freshness. When this hits the plate, it glows. It tastes cleaner than fresh because it has been suspended in its perfect state.',
